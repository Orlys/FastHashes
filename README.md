The key characteristics of the FashHashes library are:
 - `Endian-Agnostic Code` (it attemps to provide consistent results regardless of the machine byte order, while only moderately affecting the computations performance);
 - `Native/Unmanaged Memory Access` (where possible, it uses unsafe memory pointers and native Windows API calls to speed up computations);
 - `Zero-Allocation Algorithms` (all the computations are performed without allocating objects, only primitive types and/or arrays of primitive types are used).
 
### Requirements
 
The library is platform-agnostic, therefore it can be used on both x86 and x64 environments. The solution model targets Visual Studio 2017 and the projects are compiled under .NET Framework 4.7.1, therefore it can be used on every machine equipped with Windows 7 or greater.
