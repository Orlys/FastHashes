The key characteristics of the FashHashes library are:
 * `Endian-Agnostic Code` (it attemps to provide consistent results regardless of the machine byte order, while only moderately affecting the computations performance);
 * `Native/Unmanaged Memory Access` (where possible, it uses unsafe memory pointers and native Windows API calls to speed up computations);
 * `Zero-Allocation Algorithms` (all the computations are performed without allocating objects, only primitive types and/or arrays of primitive types are used).
 
### Requirements
 
The library is os-agnostic (it has been developed under .NET Standard 2.0) and platform-agnostic, (both x86 and x64 environments are supported). The project targets Visual Studio 2017.

The tests above have been conducted with the following machine setup:

 * `CPU:` Intel Core i7-7700HQ @2.80GHz (4 Cores, 8 Threads, 256KB L1 Cache)
 * `RAM:` 16 GB x DDR4 SO-DIMM @1200MHz
 * `OS:` Microsoft Windows 10 64-Bit

## The Test Suite

FashHashes.Tests is a testing framework for the FastHashes library. It implements a lot of different tests, most of which are taken from [SMHasher](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher) and its most notable forks:

 * [https://github.com/demerphq/smhasher/](https://github.com/demerphq/smhasher/)
 * [https://github.com/rurban/smhasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher)
 
Here is an exhaustive list of the implemented tests:

 - **Quality Tests**
   - Avalanche Test
   - Bit Independence Criterion Test
   - Differential Test
 - **Speed Tests**
   - Bulk Speed Test
   - Chunks Speed Test
 - **Validation Tests**
   - Combinations Test
   - Cyclic Keys Test
   - Flipped Keys Test
   - Key Sets Test
   - Padded Keys Test
   - Sparse Keys Test
   - Two Bytes Test
   - Uniform Keys Test
   - Windowed Keys Test
   - Words Test (the `Words.txt` file used by this test is taken from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/wchargin/8927565))
   
Most of them are very CPU intensive and/or utilize a lot of virtual memory.
   
### Requirements
 
The project targets Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Framework 4.7.1, therefore it can be used on every machine equipped with Windows 7 or greater. The application is platform-agnostic, therefore it can be used on both x86 and x64 environments. The application requires administration privileges in order to work properly; a semi-automatic elevation routine is included in the application manifest file.

### Usage

FashHashes.Tests is a console application that needs to be executed through command line instructions.

 * Display the help section:
   * `FashHashes.Tests -help`
 * Run the specified tests on the specified hashes:
   * `FashHashes.Tests -hashes [ALL | H1 ... Hn] (default: ALL) -tests [ALL | T1 ... Tn] (default: V0)`

*[EXAMPLE 1]* Run validation and quality tests on all the available hashes and save the result on a text file:

    FashHashes.Tests -tests Q V1 >> Results.txt
    
*[EXAMPLE 2]* Run all the tests on all the available hashes:

    FashHashes.Tests -tests ALL
    
*[EXAMPLE 3]* Run all the tests on FastHash64 and MurmurHash64 (x64 variant) and display the results in the console output:

    FashHashes.Tests -hashes FastHash64 MurmurHash64_x64 -tests ALL
